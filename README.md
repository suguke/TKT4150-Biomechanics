# TKT4150-Biomechanics
Course content
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a continuum mechanical approach (solid and fluid mechanics) the following topics are addressed: 
-mechanical properties of biofluids and biosolids, blood rheology, blood flow in arteries and veins, mechanical behaviour of skeletal muscles/heart muscle. Relevant ongoing research activities will be presented in some lectures accompanied with illustrative examples if possible.

Learning outcome:
-This course will present fundamental concepts in mathematical modeling of biological tissues and blood flow, with a particular focus on cardiovascular applications The course has the following learning objectives: 

Knowledge: 
-The candidate will acquire knowledge about: Fundamental continuum mechanics (structural mechanics, fluid mechanics, rheology). Mechanical properties of biomaterials and blood. Blood flow and wave propagation in arteries and veins. Simplified models for the heart and the vascular tree. 

Skills: 
-The candidate can: Compute stresses and strains for a hyperelastic model of a biological membrane. Compute wall stresses in a simple heart model. Compute the velocity profiles for various blood flow models in straight pipes. Compute the impedance for a Windkessel model of the arterial tree. Carry out wave splitting of waves in compliant vessels. Carry out parameter estimation of model parameters based on measurements and models. 

General competence: 
-The candidate can: Fundamental principles in continuum mechanics. Utilize continuum mechanical principles on biomechanical problems. 

Learning methods and activities:
-Lectures, computer execises and written exercises out of which at least 2/3 must be approved for exam admittance. The lectures and exercises are in English when students who do not speak Norwegian take the course. If the teaching is given in English the Examination papers will be given in English only. Students are free to choose Norwegian or English for written assessments.

Recommended previous knowledge:
-The course is based on basic courses in solid and fluid mechanics and mathematics. Some background in continuum mechanics is recommended.
